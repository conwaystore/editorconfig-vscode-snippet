EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

**Note**: Microsoft's own `vscode-editorconfig` by Chris Dias is now [deprecated](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-editorconfig/issues/23). Instead use the [official extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) published by EditorConfig.
